### Description 
This is a website for a new mutual aid organization based in Queens, NYC. Languages used in this project include HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. _Related News_ page includes an API call that fetches NYC/mutual aid current news. A Facebook and Twitter page has not yet been created from the organization; hence not included on the site. Next steps would be using a Venmo API for the organization to collect donations.
