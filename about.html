        <h3>Our History</h3>
        <div class="row">
            <div class="text-container">
                <p>
                    Our story began with a simple idea: to bring warmth and connection to our neighbors in need. Over the last couple of months, we’ve grown into a trusted community partner, fostering care and compassion through our programs and services. As a group of recent college graduates from Queens, NYC, we recognized the pressing need for social justice and community support. We saw the struggles of many in our community who lacked access to basic necessities, and we knew we had the power to make a difference.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Partnering with local mutual aid organizations, we collect food leftovers from restaurants, grocery stores, and local food banks, distributing them to those facing food insecurity in our neighborhoods. What started as a small-scale effort with a few volunteers has blossomed into a full-fledged initiative, providing not only meals but also essential supplies like clothing, hygiene products, and educational resources. Our programs have expanded to include community meals, neighborhood clean-ups, and outreach events designed to strengthen bonds between residents.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our journey reflects our commitment to uplifting our community, creating a network of support, and inspiring others to join us in this vital cause. We are not just distributing food; we are building relationships, breaking down barriers, and creating a space where every individual is treated with dignity and respect. Through partnerships with local businesses and community leaders, we’ve been able to scale our impact, providing resources to thousands of individuals who would otherwise be overlooked.
                </p>
                <p> 
                    We are driven by the belief that a stronger community is one that cares for each other, lifting up those who are most vulnerable. We strive to lead by example, showing that every small act of kindness can have a ripple effect, creating a more just and compassionate world. Together, we are building a more equitable future for all, one where no one is left behind and where everyone has access to the support and opportunities they deserve.
