                    I donâ€™t know what your destiny will be, but one thing I do know: the only ones among you who will be really happy are those who have sought and found how to serve. True happiness comes from the joy of deeds well done, the zest of creating things new. The purpose of human life is to serve, and to show compassion and the will to help others.</p>
